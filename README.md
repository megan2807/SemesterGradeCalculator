# Semester Grade Calculator C++ Program

This is a simple C++ console application designed to help students calculate their semester average percentage and determine their final letter grade based on five input marks.

## How it Works

The program prompts the user to enter five individual marks. It then calculates the sum of these marks and divides by five to get the average percentage. Finally, it applies a basic grading scale to output the corresponding letter grade:

* **A+**: 85% or higher
* **B+**: 75% - 84%
* **C+**: 65% - 74%
* **D+**: 50% - 64%
* **F**: Below 50%

## Example Usage
Enter a mark: 90
Enter a mark: 80
Enter a mark: 70
Enter a mark: 60
Enter a mark: 50
Your grade is: B+
